## Background

My first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation at Pewlett Hackard from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

In this assignment, I designed the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, I performed:

1. Data Engineering

2. Data Analysis
